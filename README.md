# imageRecognition
Image recognition project using coreML.

1. Downloaded a pre-existing Caffe Model and converted it to machine learning model using python PIP. 
2. Once the picture is taken, the CoreML model will identify the picture and display the name of the flower in the navigation bar.
3. Connected my program with Wikipedia’s API and took the details of the flower using cocoaPods’s Alamofire.
4. Retrieved the details of the flower and source image from Wikipedia using Alamofire and displayed it in the screen.
